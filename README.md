Requires AutoHotKey v2 installed on your system

Download it from here: https://www.autohotkey.com/

ALL INFO BELOW IS NOT CORRECT FOR THIS MACRO.  I WILL UPDATE EVENTUALLY

When you download the macro file, extract all and open the "AutoFish.ahk" file
- F1 to activate the macro when it's open
- F2 to deactivate the macro when it's active
- F6 to grab coordinates of the current mouse positon, will show in a message box on screen
- F7 to rejoin game

YouTube demonstration (out of date, please update Collector): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnuKIOsgnUc&t=4s

For whatever reason the main script isn't in a separate folder when you download, please put it in one so the config file created when you first exit the macro saves in the same directory.

You'll need F6 if you play on resolutions other than 1920x1080 to edit line 16 and 17. This is the coordinates for any white pixel on the "Keep tapping to reel" text.

Lines you may have to edit depending on your system and internet connection (I can't make this suit everyone without being very generous on the timings). Lines grouped together on the list serve the same purpose so make them the same if you change them.
- 58 and 60
- 84
- 92
- 94 (would not recommend changing for anyone but you may increase it ever so slightly if necessary)
- 100

Open in notepad or a code editor to change the lines specified

The code is commented so you may understand how it works. Enjoy easy afk fishing!

Future plans:
- I am working on disconnect detection but it is a lot of work. Preston has system in place to try making macros hard as possible to setup so give me some more time. 
- QoL improvements to GUI
